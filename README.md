# Dijkstra-Routing-Interactive-Program

Welcome to our interactive program designed to teach and demonstrate Dijkstra's Algorithm for network routing. This project is part of our CSE 151 - Advanced Computer Networking class final project. This project was in collaboration with Joseph Chang. 

## Overview
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a famous algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This project provides an interactive menu-driven program that allows users to learn about Dijkstra's Algorithm, see it in action, and explore its applications in network routing.

## Features
Interactive Menu: Navigate through the program using an easy-to-use menu system.
Educational Content: Learn about the fundamentals of Dijkstra's Algorithm, including its purpose, steps, and real-world applications.
Algorithm Visualization: Watch the algorithm find the shortest path in a given network.
Hands-on Practice: Input your own network data and see Dijkstra's Algorithm in action.

## Files
dijkstra.py: Contains the implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using heapq.
graph.py: Contains the graph visualization using matplotlib and networkx.
main.py: The main program file that ties everything together and provides the interactive menu.

## Demo
